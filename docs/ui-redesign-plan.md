# UI Redesign Plan for FitAI

## Project Overview ✅

FitAI will undergo a comprehensive UI redesign adopting a "Bold Minimalism" design principle - a sleek, modern approach that emphasizes functional elegance through minimalist design elements and bold typographic choices. This approach will significantly enhance the premium feel of the application while improving usability.

## Design Philosophy ✅

The "Bold Minimalism" design principle focuses on:

1. **Simplicity with Impact** - Clean layouts with strategic use of bold elements
2. **Typography as Design** - Using typography not just for reading but as a central design element
3. **Purposeful Animation** - Subtle animations that enhance understanding without distraction
4. **Functional Elegance** - Beauty derived from function, not ornament
5. **Space as Luxury** - Generous use of whitespace to create a premium, uncluttered feel

## Visual Design System ✅

### Color Palette ✅

- **Primary Colors**: Deep black (#0F0F0F) and pure white (#FFFFFF) as foundation
- **Accent Colors**: Vibrant gradient from electric blue (#0496FF) to energetic purple (#9747FF)
- **Status Colors**: Success (#05A660), Warning (#FFBE0B), Error (#F53D3D)
- **Background Tones**: Near-black (#121212), Dark gray (#1E1E1E), Mid gray (#2D2D2D)
- **Text Shades**: White (#FFFFFF), Light gray (#EFEFEF), Medium gray (#B0B0B0), Deactivated (#606060)

### Typography ✅

- **Display Font**: Montserrat (Ultra Bold) for major headings and statements
- **Primary Font**: SF Pro Display for all body text, inputs, and secondary headers
- **Type Scale**: 12px (minor labels), 14px (body), 16px (inputs/buttons), 18px (section headers), 24px (screen titles), 36px+ (display text)
- **Weight Usage**: Bold (700) for headers and emphasis, Medium (500) for buttons and important text, Regular (400) for body text

### Components ✅

- **Cards**: Subtle floating effect with minimal shadows, distinct header/content areas
- **Buttons**: Three distinct types:
  - Primary: Gradient fill with white text
  - Secondary: Transparent with white border and text
  - Tertiary: Text only with optional icon
- **Inputs**: Floating label design, subtle animations, clear active states
- **Navigation**: Tab bar with bold icons, central action button with gradient highlight
- **Status Indicators**: Animation-enhanced indicators for progress, achievements

### Visual Elements ✅

- **Iconography**: Bold, minimal line icons with consistent 2px stroke weight
- **Imagery**: High-contrast black and white fitness photography with gradient color overlays
- **Illustrations**: Abstract, geometric patterns suggesting movement and energy
- **Empty States**: Meaningful, action-oriented placeholders with bold typography

## Navigation Structure ✅

The app will use a 5-tab layout:

1. **Home** - Personal dashboard with daily overview ✅
2. **Workout** - Exercise library and workout plans ✅
3. **Central Action Button** - Context-aware primary action ✅
4. **Nutrition** - Meal plans and nutrition tracking ✅
