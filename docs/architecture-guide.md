## LATEST CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (December 2025) - WORKOUT ACTIVITY SUMMARY & PROGRESS TRACKING ✅

### Workout Activity Summary Rest Day Display Issue (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: Activity summary was incorrectly showing "Rest" in the workout section even when no workout plan had been generated yet.

**Root Causes**:
- Activity summary logic was determining rest days based solely on workout preferences without checking if workouts were actually generated
- `isRestDay` calculation was running before workout plan generation, causing premature rest day indicators
- UI was showing 100% completion with "Rest" indicator when no workouts existed

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed activity summary logic to only show "Rest" when workouts have been generated AND today is not a scheduled workout day
- ✅ Updated workout percentage calculation to show 0% when no workouts exist instead of rest day indicator
- ✅ Enhanced rest day determination to consider `hasWorkouts` status before applying workout preferences
- ✅ Updated dependency arrays to properly recalculate when workout generation status changes
- ✅ Fixed streak calculation logic to also consider workout generation status

**Architecture Changes**:
- **Activity Summary Logic**: Enhanced to consider workout generation status (`hasWorkouts`) before determining rest days
- **Conditional Rest Day Display**: Rest day indicators only appear when workouts exist and today is not a workout day
- **Dependency Management**: Proper dependency arrays ensure recalculation when workout status changes
- **State Consistency**: Unified logic between UI display and streak calculation systems

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/home/index.tsx` - Fixed activity summary calculation logic, updated rest day determination, enhanced dependency tracking

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - Activity summary now correctly shows 0% before workout generation and proper rest day indicators only after workouts are generated

### Workout Progress Chart Day Mapping Issues (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: Workout completions were appearing on wrong days in Progress tab - workouts completed on Monday were showing on Thursday, and Progress tab required manual refresh to show updates.

**Root Causes**:
- Workout plan day names ("Day 1", "Day 2") were being stored instead of actual calendar day names ("Monday", "Tuesday")
- Date parsing issues causing timezone-related day calculation errors
- Progress tab not auto-refreshing when workout data changed
- Event system not properly triggering data refresh on tab focus

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed workout completion to always use actual calendar day names regardless of workout plan naming
- ✅ Enhanced date parsing with proper timezone handling to prevent day calculation errors
- ✅ Implemented reliable event-driven refresh system for Progress tab
- ✅ Added automatic data refresh when switching to Progress tab (useFocusEffect)
- ✅ Created comprehensive event emission system for workout completion and data changes
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging day name mapping and data flow

**Architecture Changes**:
- **Event System**: Implemented `EventRegister` for cross-tab communication
- **Auto-Refresh Pattern**: Progress tab always refreshes on focus for data consistency
- **Day Name Mapping**: Standardized to use actual calendar days instead of workout plan naming
- **Timezone Handling**: Enhanced date parsing with `T00:00:00` suffix for local timezone

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/workout/index.tsx` - Fixed workout completion to use actual day names, enhanced event emission
- `app/(tabs)/progress/index.tsx` - Implemented auto-refresh on focus, enhanced event listeners
- `services/trackingService.ts` - Improved day name calculation with timezone handling, added data clearing functionality

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - Workouts appear on correct days and Progress tab auto-refreshes without manual intervention

### Data Synchronization and Chart Display Issues (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: Progress charts were showing incorrect data - activities appeared on wrong days (e.g., Monday workout showing on Sunday), and 30/90-day views showed false positives across all time periods.

**Root Causes**:
- Chart date calculation logic assumed "today" was Sunday, causing incorrect day-of-week mapping
- Data aggregation for 30/90-day views was checking both date strings and day names, causing all Mondays to show activity when only one specific Monday had activity
- `workoutsPerDay` object only stored data by day name ("Monday") instead of specific dates ("2025-06-16")
- Fallback charts were hardcoded to show daily labels regardless of time period

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed chart date calculation to properly determine start of week (Monday) regardless of current day
- ✅ Enhanced data storage to include both day names (for 7-day view) and exact dates (for 30/90-day views)
- ✅ Modified aggregation logic for 30/90-day views to only check specific dates, not day names
- ✅ Implemented dynamic chart labels and scaling based on time period
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging and logging for date processing
- ✅ Applied same fixes to both workout and meal completion charts

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/progress/index.tsx` - Fixed chart date calculation, aggregation logic, and dynamic labels
- `services/trackingService.ts` - Enhanced data storage structure and added date-specific tracking
- Both workout and meal completion systems now properly handle online/offline synchronization

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - Charts now display data on correct days with proper time period aggregation

## CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (June 2025)

### AI Meal Generation System Fixes
**Issue**: Users receiving empty fallback meal plans instead of AI-generated personalized meals
**Solution**: Implemented fully working AI meal generation with Gemini 2.5 Flash

**Key Changes**:
- Removed empty fallback meal plans and forced AI generation
- Cleared rate limiting flags before generation attempts
- Enhanced meal generation pipeline with proper error handling
- Implemented multi-tier fallback system for reliability
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### Supabase Query Architecture Fixes (Previously Completed)
**Issue**: HTTP 406 and 401 errors due to improper query patterns
**Solution**: Standardized all Supabase queries to handle array responses properly

**Before**:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', userId)
  .single(); // ❌ Caused 406 errors when 0 or >1 rows returned
```

**After**:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', userId); // ✅ Returns array, handle properly

const profile = data && data.length > 0 ? data[0] : null;
```

### Error Handling Architecture
**Enhanced Pattern**: All Supabase operations now include comprehensive error handling
```typescript
if (error) {
  // Handle specific Supabase errors
  if (error.code === 'PGRST116' ||
      error.message?.includes('JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned')) {
    // Graceful handling for missing data
    console.warn("Data not found, using fallback");
    return fallbackValue;
  }

  // Handle network errors gracefully
  if (error.message?.includes('Failed to fetch')) {
    console.warn("Network error, continuing with local state");
    // Update local state and continue
    return;
  }

  throw error; // Only throw for unexpected errors
}
```

### Context Architecture Improvements
**StreakContext**: Fixed infinite loop issues
- Removed problematic dependencies from useEffect
- Added debouncing with setTimeout
- Implemented network error resilience

**ProfileContext**: Enhanced reliability
- Removed `.single()` calls causing 406 errors
- Added graceful fallback to local state
- Improved error logging and handling

```

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Navigation (Expo Router)

The application uses Expo Router for navigation, which provides a file-system based routing approach:

- `app/(tabs)/` - Main tabs accessible after login and onboarding
- `app/(auth)/` - Authentication screens (login, signup, forgot password)
- `app/(onboarding)/` - Onboarding flow screens for new users
- `app/(dev)/` - Developer tools and debug screens

Navigation between screens is primarily handled through the `router` object imported from `expo-router`:

```typescript
import { router } from 'expo-router';

// Navigate to a route
router.push('/(tabs)/home');

// Replace the current screen
router.replace('/(tabs)/');

// Go back to the previous screen
router.back();
```

### 2. Context System

FitAI uses React Context for global state management. The key contexts are:

#### AuthContext

Located in `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, this handles:
- User authentication state
- Login, signup, and logout functionality
- Session management and persistence
- Token refresh and storage

Usage:
```typescript
const { user, signIn, signOut, loading } = useAuth();
```

#### ProfileContext

Located in `contexts/ProfileContext.tsx`, this manages:
- User profile data
- Profile synchronization between local and server storage
- Profile updates and refreshing
- Onboarding state tracking

Usage:
```typescript
const { profile, updateProfile, refreshProfile } = useProfile();
```

### 3. Database Integration (Supabase)

The application uses Supabase as its backend database. The core integration is in `lib/supabase.ts`:

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY } from '../constants/api';

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true,
  },
});

export default supabase;
```

Key Supabase tables:
- `profiles` - User profile information
- `workout_completions` - Records of completed workouts
- `meal_completions` - Records of completed meals
- `workouts` - Workout plans and templates
- `meal_plans` - Meal plans and recipes
- `progress` - User progress tracking data

### 4. Data Synchronization

The application uses a dual-storage approach for data persistence:

1. **Server Storage (Supabase)**: Primary source of truth for all user data.
2. **Local Storage (AsyncStorage)**: Cache for offline access and performance.

The **Primary Synchronization Logic** has been consolidated into `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts` (this file was previously named `utils/syncLocalData.ts` and then briefly `utils/syncLocalDataToSupabase.ts` before settling on the current name). This central utility handles the critical local-to-cloud data migration and is invoked by `AuthContext.tsx` upon successful user sign-in or sign-up.

**Key responsibilities of `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`**:
  - **Profile Data**: Migrates the local user profile (from `AsyncStorage` key `local_profile`) to the Supabase `profiles` table. This includes scalar fields and JSONB columns like `diet_preferences`, `workout_preferences`, `body_analysis`, `workout_plan`, and `meal_plans`.
  - **Activity Completions**: Collects `workout_completions` and `meal_completions` from their primary (`local_workout_completions`, `local_meal_completions`) and legacy (`completed_workouts`, `meals`) AsyncStorage keys. It then merges these with existing server data, upserting into the respective Supabase tables (`workout_completions`, `meal_completions`) based on item ID and recency.
  - **Nutrition Tracking**: Data from `local_nutrition_tracking` and the legacy `nutrition_tracking` AsyncStorage keys is collected and merged into the `profiles.meal_tracking` JSONB field on the server. There is no separate `nutrition_logs` table; this data is now part of the user's profile.
  - **Plans**: `workout_plan` and `meal_plans` are synced from local storage to the respective JSONB fields in the `profiles` table, typically based on `updated_at` timestamps or if the server version is null.
  - **Data Backup & Rollback**: Includes a mechanism to back up local data before sync and potentially roll back on failure (primarily for local data integrity).
  - **AsyncStorage Cleanup**: After a successful sync of each data type, the corresponding local (including legacy) AsyncStorage keys are removed to prevent re-syncing and to clean up local storage.

**Role of Other Components**:
  - `AuthContext.tsx`: Triggers the `syncLocalDataToServer` process. Its `signOut` function is also responsible for clearing a comprehensive list of user-specific AsyncStorage keys to ensure a clean slate.
  - `ProfileContext.tsx`: Still manages the active user profile state in the application, fetches profile data from Supabase, and handles updates to the profile. Its `synchronizeProfileData` utility is used for maintaining consistency between nested objects and root-level properties *within the client-side profile state* rather than direct cloud sync.
  - `utils/dataSynchronizer.ts`: This file is now largely **deprecated**. Its main migration functions (`migrateLocalToCloud`, `performLowRiskSync`, `performHighRiskSync`) have been removed or commented out, as their responsibilities were absorbed by `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`. Some helper functions related to change logging might still be present but are not central to the current sync strategy.

### 5. AI Integration (Gemini)

FitAI uses Google's Gemini API for AI-powered features:

- Located in `services/ai/geminiService.ts`
- Used for workout generation, diet planning, and body analysis
- Configuration in `constants/api.ts`

#### Workout Generator Architecture

The application uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach for generating personalized workout plans:

1. **Pydantic-Style Generator** (`services/ai/pydanticWorkoutGenerator.ts`):
   - Implements a strongly-typed workout generation system using Zod schemas
   - Ensures consistent output format with comprehensive validation
   - Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash as the primary model for generation
   - Handles markdown code blocks and extracts valid JSON from responses
   - Robustly sanitizes exercise data, particularly the "reps" field format
   - Includes clear fallback progression with detailed error logging
   - Supports country/region-specific exercise recommendations

2. **Reliable Generator** (`services/ai/reliableWorkoutGenerator.ts`):
   - Orchestrates multiple generation methods in sequence
   - Follows a clear fallback flow:
     1. PydanticWorkoutGenerator primary method (direct generation)
     2. PydanticWorkoutGenerator backup method (step-by-step generation)
     3. StructuredWorkoutGenerator with its own fallbacks
     4. EnhancedWorkoutGenerator as final fallback
   - Ensures successful workout plan generation despite API limitations
   - Preserves all user preferences throughout the fallback chain

3. **Generation Process Flow**:
   - User preferences (including fitness level, available equipment, focus areas, etc.)
   - Primary generation attempt with structured prompts
   - JSON extraction and validation against Zod schema
   - Automatic retries for rate limits with exponential backoff
   - Graceful degradation to simpler methods if needed
   - All methods respect user preferences for personalized results

4. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limits
   - Intelligent JSON extraction from various response formats
   - Field validation and auto-sanitization for exercise parameters
   - Path-specific error reporting for empty exercise arrays
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
   - Graceful degradation to simpler generation methods

#### Meal Plan Generator Architecture

The application uses a sophisticated, hierarchical, and iterative approach for generating personalized meal plans, leveraging the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` model.

1.  **Pydantic-Style Generator (`services/ai/pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts`)**:
    *   Serves as the core LLM interaction layer for meal generation.
    *   Utilizes Zod schemas (e.g., `MealPlanSchema`, `DayPlanSchema`, `MealRecipeSchema`) for strong typing and validation of inputs and outputs. **Note: `MealRecipeSchema` and related interfaces like `MealRecipe` and `MealPlan` were simplified to only include `name` and `nutrition`, removing `ingredients`, `instructions`, `shoppingList`, `mealPrepTips`, and `batchCookingRecommendations` to streamline LLM output and reduce parsing errors.**
    *   Features robust JSON extraction from markdown, including a new private method `_extractAndRepairJson` for aggressive prefix/suffix stripping and common syntax fixes. LLM calls now also specify `responseMimeType: "application/json"` to encourage structured JSON output. Includes retry mechanisms for LLM calls.
    *   **Key Granular Generation Methods**:
        *   `generateMealPlan()`: Attempts to generate a complete 7-day meal plan in a single LLM call.
        *   `generateDailyPlan()`: Generates a meal plan for a single day, using focused prompts and `DayPlanSchema` validation.
        *   `generateSingleMealForDay()`: Generates a specific meal (e.g., breakfast) for a given day. It takes into account other meals planned for that day to provide context to the LLM, improving coherence and variety. Validates against `MealRecipeSchema`.
        *   `generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek()`: Generates all instances of a specific meal type (e.g., all breakfasts) for the entire week. It does this by orchestrating multiple calls to `generateSingleMealForDay` for each day.
    *   **Supporting Methods**:
        *   `createStaticFallbackPlan()`: Provides a basic, static, non-AI-generated meal plan. This is crucial for scenarios where API calls are to be skipped (e.g., `skipApiCalls` is true) or as an ultimate fallback.
        *   `repairAndEnrichPlan()`: Takes a potentially partial or structurally flawed meal plan (`Partial<MealPlan>`), attempts to complete its structure (most placeholder content like shopping lists/tips are no longer added due to schema simplification), and then validates it against the full `MealPlanSchema`. If validation fails, it can fall back to `createStaticFallbackPlan`.
        *   Helper functions like `ensureMinimumRequirements`, `ensureFullWeekCoverage`, and `standardizeMealPlan` are used for programmatic post-processing and ensuring the plan meets basic criteria.
        *   `finalizeMealPlan()`: Prepares the meal plan for final output, potentially after iterative building. It's designed to handle `Partial<MealPlan>` inputs.

2.  **Reliable Meal Plan Generator (`services/ai/index.ts` - object named `reliableMealPlanGenerator`)**:
    *   Acts as the primary orchestrator for the meal plan generation process.
    *   Its main method, `generateMealPlan(preferences: UserDietPreferences, skipApiCalls?: boolean)`, implements a hierarchical, multi-attempt strategy:
        *   **`skipApiCalls` Handling**: If `skipApiCalls` is `true`, it immediately calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan()` and returns, bypassing all LLM interactions. This is used for development, testing, or when API quotas are a concern.
        *   **Attempt 1: Full 7-Day Plan Generation**:
            *   Calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateMealPlan()` to attempt generating the entire week's plan at once.
            *   If successful and valid, the plan is returned.
        *   **Attempt 2: Day-by-Day Generation**:
            *   If Attempt 1 fails, it iterates from Day 1 to Day 7.
            *   For each day, it calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateDailyPlan()`.
            *   If `generateDailyPlan()` for a specific day fails, it then attempts to generate each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) for *that failing day* individually using `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateSingleMealForDay()`.
            *   The results from each successful daily/meal generation are accumulated.
            *   If a valid 7-day plan is constructed, it's returned.
        *   **Attempt 3: Meal-Type by Meal-Type Generation**:
            *   If Attempt 2 fails to produce a complete plan, this strategy is invoked.
            *   It iterates through each meal type (e.g., "breakfast", "lunch", "dinner", "snacks").
            *   For each meal type, it calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek()` to generate, for example, all breakfasts for the week, then all lunches, etc.
            *   The results are accumulated.
            *   If a valid 7-day plan is constructed, it's returned.
        *   **Attempt 4: Repair, Enrich, and Final Fallback**:
            *   If the plan assembled from the previous attempts is still incomplete or structurally invalid, it's passed to `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.repairAndEnrichPlan()`.
            *   This method attempts to fix the plan and add any missing essential components.
            *   If `repairAndEnrichPlan()` successfully produces a valid `MealPlan`, it's returned.
            *   If all above attempts fail to yield a valid plan, `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan()` is called as the ultimate fallback, ensuring the user always receives some form of meal plan.
    *   Employs comprehensive error handling and logging throughout its orchestration logic to track the success or failure of each generation step.

3.  **Generation Process Flow & Key Concepts**:
    *   **User Preferences**: Takes `UserDietPreferences` as input, which guides all LLM prompts.
    *   **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` is the underlying LLM.
    *   **Prompt Engineering**: Prompts are specifically designed for each generation function (full plan, daily, single meal) to maximize relevance, diversity, and adherence to user preferences (e.g., regional cuisine). **Prompts were updated to request only meal names and nutritional information, aligning with the simplified schemas.**
    *   **Zod Schemas**: Enforce data integrity at each step. `pydanticMealPlanGenerator` methods validate their outputs against these schemas.
    *   **Iterative & Hierarchical**: The system tries broad generation first, then progressively narrower, more granular strategies if failures occur. This improves reliability.
    *   **JSON Handling**: Robust extraction and parsing of JSON from LLM responses, including retries and repair attempts.
    *   **Fallback Chain**: Multiple layers of fallbacks ensure that the system is resilient to LLM failures or unexpected outputs, culminating in a static plan if necessary.

4.  **Error Handling Strategy**:
    *   Retry logic with exponential backoff for LLM API calls (handled within `pydanticMealPlanGenerator`).
    *   Detailed logging at each stage of the `reliableMealPlanGenerator`'s orchestration to trace issues.
    *   Validation errors from Zod schemas guide retry attempts or fallback decisions.
    *   The hierarchical nature itself is a core part of error handling, providing alternative paths if one strategy fails.

## Database Schema

### Profiles Table Structure

The `profiles` table is the core of user data storage:

1. **Scalar Fields**:
   - `id` (primary key, matches auth.users.id)
   - `full_name` (string) - Added to ensure user's full name is stored.
   - `has_completed_onboarding` (boolean)
   - `current_onboarding_step` (string)
   - `height_cm` (number)
   - `weight_kg` (number)
   - `target_weight_kg` (number)
   - `streak_days` (number)

2. **JSONB Fields**:
   - `diet_preferences` - Contains all diet related data
   - `workout_preferences` - Contains all workout related data
   - `body_analysis` - Contains all body-related data
   - `workout_plan` - Contains the current workout plan
   - `meal_plans` - Contains the current meal plans
   - `meal_tracking` (JSONB) - Stores detailed nutrition/meal log entries. This is where data from `local_nutrition_tracking` is synced.

### Field Duplication Strategy

To optimize for both query performance and flexibility:

1. Critical data is stored both at root level (scalar fields) and in JSONB objects.
2. Root-level properties are used for direct database queries.
3. JSONB fields store complete objects including additional properties.
4. The `synchronizeProfileData` utility ensures consistency between both locations.

### Meal Tracking Flow

1. User logs a meal in the Nutrition tab or via other logging mechanisms.
2. `markMealComplete()` is called from `trackingService.ts`.
3. Completion record is saved to `meal_completions` table (for summary/streak) and potentially detailed nutrition data is saved locally to `local_nutrition_tracking`.
4. Upon next login/signup, `syncLocalDataToServer` will merge items from `local_nutrition_tracking` into the `profiles.meal_tracking` JSONB field.
5. `getMealStats()` is called to update meal statistics (likely reads from `meal_completions`).
6. Home tab shows updated meal completion status.

## Component Design Patterns

### 1. Component Composition

The application uses component composition extensively:

```tsx
// Example from nutrition tab
<MealCard>
  <MealHeader title={meal.title} time={meal.time} />
  <MealContent>
    <MealImage source={meal.image} />
    <MealDescription text={meal.description} />
  </MealContent>
  <MealActions onComplete={handleComplete} />
</MealCard>
```

### 2. Custom Hooks for Logic Separation

Custom hooks are used to separate business logic from presentation:

```tsx
// hooks/useWorkoutProgress.ts
export function useWorkoutProgress(userId: string) {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState<WorkoutStats | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    async function loadStats() {
      const workoutStats = await getWorkoutStats(userId);
      setStats(workoutStats);
    }
    
    loadStats();
  }, [userId]);
  
  return stats;
}

// Usage in component
const workoutStats = useWorkoutProgress(user.id);
```

### 3. Conditional Rendering with Fallbacks

Components handle loading, error, and empty states:

```tsx
// Example pattern used throughout the app
{loading ? (
  <LoadingIndicator />
) : error ? (
  <ErrorMessage message={error} onRetry={handleRetry} />
) : !data || data.length === 0 ? (
  <EmptyState message="No data available" />
) : (
  <DataDisplay data={data} />
)}
```

## Utility Functions

The application includes several important utility functions:

### Profile Data Management

- `synchronizeProfileData` - Ensures data consistency between nested objects and root properties
- `deepMerge` - Merges nested objects with proper handling of arrays and objects
- `processUnitConversions` - Converts between imperial and metric units
- `sanitizeForDatabase` - Filters properties to only include valid database columns

### Progress Calculation

- `getWorkoutStats` - Calculates workout completion statistics
- `getMealStats` - Calculates meal completion statistics
- `calculateDayStreak` - Determines the current streak of consecutive days with activity

## Streak Calculation System

### Overview
The streak system tracks consecutive days of completed fitness activities, motivating users to maintain consistent habits.

### Streak Requirements
- **Workout Days**: Requires BOTH workout completion AND all three meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- **Rest Days**: Requires all three meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) completed

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface StreakData {
  currentStreak: number;
  lastCompletionDate: string | null;
  activityHistory: {
    [date: string]: {
      workouts: boolean;
      meals: {
        breakfast: boolean;
        lunch: boolean;
        dinner: boolean;
      };
      water: boolean;
    }
  };
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

### Core Functions

#### `areDailyActivitiesCompleted(history, dateString, isRestDay)`
Determines if all required activities for a day are completed:
- **Rest Days**: `areAllMealsCompleted(dayData.meals)`
- **Workout Days**: `dayData.workouts && areAllMealsCompleted(dayData.meals)`

#### `processActivityCompletion(userId, activityType, completed, isRestDay, mealType)`
Records individual activity completions and updates streak when all requirements are met.

#### `recordMealCompletion(userId, isRestDay, mealType)`
Convenience function for recording specific meal completions (breakfast/lunch/dinner).

### Event Flow
1. User completes a meal → `markMealComplete()` in `trackingService.ts`
2. Emits `mealCompleted` event with meal type
3. `MealCompletionHandler` listens and calls `StreakContext.recordMeal(mealType)`
4. `StreakContext` calls `recordMealCompletion()` with specific meal type
5. Streak manager updates individual meal flag and checks if day is complete
6. If complete, streak is incremented and `streakUpdated` event is emitted

### Data Migration
The system automatically migrates existing streak data from the old format:
```typescript
// OLD FORMAT
meals: boolean

// NEW FORMAT
meals: {
  breakfast: boolean,
  lunch: boolean,
  dinner: boolean
}
```

### Storage and Synchronization
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage with key `streak_data`
- **Server Sync**: Synced to `profiles.workout_tracking.streak` field
- **Conflict Resolution**: Takes maximum streak between local and server data

### Unit Conversions

- `feetToCm` - Converts height from feet/inches to centimeters
- `cmToFeet` - Converts height from centimeters to feet/inches
- `lbsToKg` - Converts weight from pounds to kilograms
- `kgToLbs` - Converts weight from kilograms to pounds

### AI Utilities

- `extractJsonFromText` - Extracts JSON data from text responses containing code blocks or raw JSON
- `extractAndPreprocessJson` - Extracts and validates JSON, ensuring it meets minimum requirements
- `ensureMinimumRequirements` - Adds default values for missing required fields in workout plans
- `retryWithExponentialBackoff` - Implements retry logic for handling API rate limits

## Error Handling Strategy

The application uses a multi-layer error handling approach:

1. **Try/Catch Blocks** - Used in all async operations
2. **Error States** - Components track error states for display
3. **Fallback Data** - Default values provided when data is missing
4. **Logging** - Comprehensive logging for debugging
5. **Retry Mechanisms** - Critical operations include retry logic

Example error handling pattern:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await apiCall();
  setData(result);
  setError(null);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error in operation:', err);
  setError('Failed to load data. Please try again.');
  // Provide fallback data if available
  setData(fallbackData);
} finally {
  setLoading(false);
}
```

## Key Files for System Migration

When migrating this application to a new system, these files are critical:

1. **`constants/api.ts`** - Contains API endpoints and keys
2. **`lib/supabase.ts`** - Supabase client configuration
3. **`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - Authentication logic
4. **`contexts/ProfileContext.tsx`** - Profile data management
5. **`services/trackingService.ts`** - Workout and meal tracking
6. **`utils/profileSynchronizer.ts`** - Data synchronization utilities

## Cross-Platform Considerations

The application is designed to work on multiple platforms:

1. **iOS/Android Differences**:
   - Platform-specific time picker implementations
   - Different keyboard behavior handling
   - Native component adaptations

2. **Web Compatibility**:
   - Web-friendly animations with graceful degradation
   - Touch vs. click event handling
   - Responsive layouts for various screen sizes

## Performance Optimizations

The application includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Memoization** - React.memo and useMemo for expensive components and calculations
2. **Local Caching** - AsyncStorage for offline access and reduced API calls
3. **Lazy Loading** - Components and screens loaded only when needed
4. **Debouncing** - Input handlers debounced to reduce unnecessary processing
5. **Image Optimization** - Proper sizing and caching of images

## Testing Approach

The application can be tested using:

1. **Unit Tests** - For utility functions and hooks
2. **Component Tests** - For UI components
3. **Integration Tests** - For flows like authentication and onboarding
4. **E2E Tests** - For critical user journeys

## Debugging Tools

The application includes built-in debugging tools:

1. **Debug Panel** - Located at `app/(dev)/debug-panel.tsx`
2. **Profile Inspector** - For examining profile data structure
3. **Logging System** - Comprehensive logging for tracking data flow
4. **Data Migration Utilities** - For fixing data inconsistencies

## Hidden Test Features

The application includes several hidden testing features that are conditionally rendered based on development mode:

1. **Test Menu Access**:
   - Test buttons and debug menus are conditionally rendered using the `__DEV__` flag
   - Hidden from end users in production builds
   - Visible only in development mode or when manually enabled
   - Located primarily in the Workout and Nutrition tabs

2. **Test Generation Utilities**:
   - In the Nutrition tab, test generation buttons are available at the bottom of the screen
   - Test buttons for alternative meal plan generation approaches are hidden behind the `__DEV__` flag
   - Workout tab has similar test buttons for trying different workout generation methods
   - These provide a way to test fallback generation systems without modifying code

3. **Debug Controls Container**:
   - Located at the bottom of key screens with the `styles.debugContainer` styling
   - Includes buttons for logging data structures, forcing regeneration, and testing edge cases
   - All wrapped in conditional rendering: `{__DEV__ && (<View>...</View>)}`
   - Can be temporarily enabled in production for troubleshooting by adding a special flag

4. **Developer Access Pattern**:
   - To access test features in development builds:
     - Run the app in development mode (`npm run start`)
     - Test features will be automatically visible
   - To access test features in production (for emergency troubleshooting):
     - Add `enableDebugMode` flag to profile (via debug panel or direct database edit)
     - This reveals the normally hidden test UI components

These testing features are essential for developers to verify the correct functioning of complex systems like AI generation, while keeping the UI clean for end users.

## Data Persistence Safeguards

The application implements several safeguards to ensure critical user data is always preserved and properly displayed:

### Field Preservation Mechanisms

To ensure that important fields like `full_name` are never lost during database operations:

1. **Enhanced Sanitization Process**:
   ```typescript
   function sanitizeForDatabase(data: Record<string, any>): Record<string, any> {
     // Get the filtered data using the database columns
     const filteredData = filterToDatabaseColumns(data);
     
     // Ensure critical fields are always included
     if (data.full_name) {
       filteredData.full_name = data.full_name;
     }
     
     // Additional logging for verification
     console.log('SANITIZE: Preserving critical fields in database update');
     
     return filteredData;
   }
   ```

2. **Explicit Column Inclusion**:
   The `DATABASE_COLUMNS` array explicitly includes all critical fields to ensure they're never filtered out:
   ```typescript
   export const DATABASE_COLUMNS = [
     'id',
     'username',
     'full_name',
     'height_cm',
     'weight_kg',
     // ... other columns
   ];
   ```

3. **Multi-level Fallback Strategy**:
   When displaying user data, multiple fallback paths ensure data is shown even if the primary source is missing:
   ```typescript
   // Example of user name display with fallbacks
   const userName = profile?.full_name || user?.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User';
   
   // Example of first name extraction with fallback
   const firstName = profile?.full_name ? profile.full_name.split(' ')[0] : 'User';
   ```

4. **Comprehensive Logging**:
   Detailed logging throughout the synchronization process helps identify and troubleshoot issues:
   ```typescript
   console.log('SANITIZE: Final filtered data includes full_name:', filteredData.full_name);
   console.log('FETCH PROFILE: Profile found with full_name:', data.full_name);
   ```

### Data Display Improvements

Several improvements ensure data is properly displayed throughout the application:

1. **Personalized Greetings**:
   The home screen displays personalized greetings using the user's first name:
   ```typescript
   const firstName = profile?.full_name ? profile.full_name.split(' ')[0] : 'User';
   return <Text>Good {getTimeOfDay()}, {firstName}</Text>;
   ```

2. **Enhanced Progress Calculation**:
   Weight goal progress percentage is calculated with improved accuracy:
   ```typescript
   function calculateProgressPercentage(profile: UserProfile): number {
     if (!profile) return 0;
     
     const currentWeight = profile?.weight_kg || profile?.current_weight_kg;
     const startWeight = profile?.starting_weight_kg || profile?.initial_weight_kg;
     const targetWeight = profile?.target_weight_kg;
     
     if (!currentWeight || !startWeight || !targetWeight) return 0;
     
     // Different calculation based on weight loss vs. weight gain
     const isWeightLoss = startWeight > targetWeight;
     
     if (isWeightLoss) {
       const totalToLose = startWeight - targetWeight;
       const lostSoFar = startWeight - currentWeight;
       return Math.min(100, Math.max(0, (lostSoFar / totalToLose) * 100));
     } else {
       const totalToGain = targetWeight - startWeight;
       const gainedSoFar = currentWeight - startWeight;
       return Math.min(100, Math.max(0, (gainedSoFar / totalToGain) * 100));
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Measurement Formatting**:
   Measurements are properly formatted with appropriate rounding:
   ```typescript
   // Weight with proper rounding
   const displayWeight = profile?.weight_kg 
     ? `${Math.round(profile.weight_kg)} kg` 
     : 'Not set';
   
   // Height with proper rounding
   const displayHeight = profile?.height_cm 
     ? `${Math.round(profile.height_cm)} cm` 
     : 'Not set';
   ```

These improvements collectively ensure that user data is properly persisted, synchronized, and displayed throughout the application, enhancing both data integrity and user experience.

## Notification System Architecture

The FitAI application implements a sophisticated notification system that provides timely reminders for workouts, meals, and water consumption while respecting user preferences and activity patterns.

### 1. Core Components

#### Notification Service (`services/notifications/index.ts`)

This is the central module that manages all notification functionality:

- **Initialization**: Sets up notification handlers and permissions
- **Scheduling**: Creates and manages notification schedules based on user preferences
- **Cancellation**: Provides methods to cancel specific or all notifications
- **User Preference Management**: Reads and applies user-defined notification settings
- **Activity Tracking**: Monitors user activity to send context-appropriate reminders

#### Initialization Module (`services/notifications/init.ts`)

A dedicated module that ensures notifications are properly initialized when the app starts:

```typescript
/**
 * Notification Service Initialization
 * This file automatically initializes the notification service when imported
 */

import NotificationService from './index';

/**
 * Initialize all notification services
 * This function sets up notifications and handles any errors that occur
 */
export async function initializeNotifications() {
  try {
    await NotificationService.setupNotifications();
    console.log('Notification service initialized successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to initialize notification service:', error);
  }
}

// Auto-initialize when this module is imported
initializeNotifications();

export default initializeNotifications;
```

This module is imported in the app's entry points (`app/index.tsx` and `app/_layout.tsx`) to ensure notification setup occurs at startup.

### 2. Notification Types

The system manages three primary notification types:

#### Workout Reminders

- Scheduled based on user's preferred workout times from onboarding
- Customized based on workout frequency and schedule
- Adjustable through profile settings
- Contains motivational messaging and workout information

#### Meal Reminders

- Scheduled according to user-specified meal times
- Customized for breakfast, lunch, and dinner
- Adaptable based on meal frequency preferences
- Includes meal plan information when available

#### Water Reminders

- Sent hourly during active hours (before 9 PM)
- Only triggered if the user hasn't logged water in the past hour
- Directly integrated with the water tracking system
- Intelligently adapts to user's hydration patterns

### 3. Integration with User Activity

The notification system is tightly integrated with user activity tracking:

#### Water Tracking Integration

When a user logs water consumption, the system updates the notification service:

```typescript
// Save water tracking data to profile
const saveWaterData = async (newWaterData: WaterTracking) => {
  if (!profile) return;

  try {
    // Create a new object for workout_tracking
    const newWorkoutTracking = {
      ...(typeof profile.workout_tracking === 'object' && 
         !Array.isArray(profile.workout_tracking) ? 
         profile.workout_tracking : {}),
      water_tracking: newWaterData
    };
    
    // Update the profile
    await updateProfile({
      workout_tracking: newWorkoutTracking
    });
    
    // Notify the notification service about the water log
    await NotificationService.updateLastWaterLogTime();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving water tracking data:', error);
  }
};
```

This ensures that water reminders are only sent when the user hasn't logged water recently, preventing notification fatigue.

#### Workout Completion Integration

When workouts are completed, the notification system is updated to avoid sending redundant reminders.

#### Meal Logging Integration

Meal completion is tracked to ensure meal reminders are contextually appropriate.

### 4. User Preference Management

The system respects user preferences for notifications:

- **Profile Settings**: Users can enable/disable specific notification types
- **Time Preferences**: Notification timing is based on user-specified schedules
- **Frequency Control**: Notifications are paced to avoid overwhelming the user
- **Quiet Hours**: No notifications are sent during late evening hours (after 9 PM)

### 5. Technical Implementation Details

#### Initialization Flow

1. App starts and imports the notification initialization module
2. `initializeNotifications()` runs automatically
3. The function calls `NotificationService.setupNotifications()`
4. The service checks for permissions and requests them if needed
5. Once permissions are granted, notification schedules are created
6. The system registers notification handlers for received notifications
7. Error handling ensures the app continues to function even if notification setup fails

#### Cross-Platform Considerations

The notification system is designed to work consistently across platforms:

- Uses Expo's notification API for cross-platform compatibility
- Handles platform-specific permission models
- Adapts notification styling to match platform conventions
- Implements proper icon and sound support for each platform

#### Error Handling Strategy

The system implements robust error handling:

- Graceful permission denial handling
- Recovery from initialization failures
- Fallback to default schedules when user preferences are unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for debugging notification issues
- Automatic retry mechanisms for critical operations

### 6. Debugging Facilities

For developers, the notification system includes several debugging features:

- Detailed console logging of notification events
- Test buttons in development builds for triggering specific notifications
- Debug flags for enabling verbose logging
- Error reporting with actionable context

### 7. Future Enhancements

The notification architecture is designed to support future enhancements:

- Rich media notifications with exercise demonstrations
- Progress-based notification content
- AI-powered adaptive notification timing
- Custom notification sounds and appearance
- Deep linking to relevant app sections from notifications

This comprehensive notification system enhances user engagement while respecting user preferences and activity patterns, creating a supportive but non-intrusive experience that encourages consistent fitness and nutrition habits.

## Local Mode Architecture

The application now supports full functionality without requiring user authentication:

### Local Profile Management

1. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Primary storage: AsyncStorage for local profiles
   - Key pattern: `profile_local` for storing non-authenticated user data
   - Comprehensive CRUD operations in ProfileContext for local profiles

2. **Implementation Details**:
   ```typescript
   // ProfileContext.tsx
   // Create a local profile for non-authenticated users
   const createLocalProfile = async () => {
     const localProfileId = `local_${Date.now()}`;
     const newProfile = {
       id: localProfileId,
       has_completed_local_onboarding: false,
       current_step: 'user-details',
       // Default properties for new local profiles
     };
     
     await AsyncStorage.setItem('profile_local', JSON.stringify(newProfile));
     setProfile(newProfile);
   };
   ```

3. **Synchronization Mechanism**:
   - Local profiles are synchronized within AsyncStorage only
   - All profile updates use the same updateProfile method, but bypass Supabase
   - Local data is preserved until explicitly cleared or user authenticates

### Enhanced Data Repair Systems

1. **Meal Plan Validation and Repair**:
   - The application now implements sophisticated data repair for incomplete meal plans:
   
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced validateAndRepairMealPlan function
   const validateAndRepairMealPlan = (plan: any): MealPlan => {
     // Find days with complete meal sets to use as templates
     const completeDays = plan.weeklyPlan.filter(d => 
       d.meals && Array.isArray(d.meals) && d.meals.length >= 3
     );
     
     if (completeDays.length > 0) {
       const templateDay = completeDays[0];
       
       // Check each day and ensure it has a complete set of meals
       for (const dayPlan of plan.weeklyPlan) {
         if (!dayPlan.meals || !Array.isArray(dayPlan.meals) || dayPlan.meals.length < 3) {
           // Initialize meals array if needed
           if (!dayPlan.meals) {
             dayPlan.meals = [];
           }
           
           // Get existing meal types to avoid duplicates
           const existingMealTypes = new Set(dayPlan.meals.map(m => m.meal.toLowerCase()));
           
           // Add missing meal types from the template day
           templateDay.meals.forEach(templateMeal => {
             if (!existingMealTypes.has(templateMeal.meal.toLowerCase())) {
               // Create a variation of the template meal
               const newMeal = {
                 meal: templateMeal.meal,
                 time: templateMeal.time,
                 recipe: {
                   name: `${templateMeal.recipe.name} ${dayPlan.day} Variation`,
                   ingredients: [...templateMeal.recipe.ingredients],
                   instructions: [...templateMeal.recipe.instructions],
                   nutrition: {...templateMeal.recipe.nutrition}
                 }
               };
               
               // Add to the day's meals
               dayPlan.meals.push(newMeal);
             }
           });
           
           // Update daily nutrition
           dayPlan.dailyNutrition = {
             calories: dayPlan.meals.reduce((sum, meal) => sum + (meal.recipe?.nutrition?.calories || 0), 0),
             protein: dayPlan.meals.reduce((sum, meal) => sum + (meal.recipe?.nutrition?.protein || 0), 0),
             carbs: dayPlan.meals.reduce((sum, meal) => sum + (meal.recipe?.nutrition?.carbs || 0), 0),
             fats: dayPlan.meals.reduce((sum, meal) => sum + (meal.recipe?.nutrition?.fats || 0), 0)
           };
         }
       }
     }
     
     return {
       id: plan.id || 'generated_meal_plan_' + Date.now(),
       weeklyPlan: plan.weeklyPlan,
       // Other properties...
     };
   };
   ```

2. **Workout Generation Preferences Mapping**:
   - Fixed compatibility issues between profile data and AI generation requirements:
   
   ```typescript
   // User preferences mapping in WorkoutScreen
   const userPreferences = {
     // Core preferences from scalar fields
     fitnessLevel: (profile?.fitness_level || "beginner") as "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced",
     exerciseFrequency: profile?.workout_days_per_week || 3,
     timePerSession: profile?.workout_duration_minutes || 30,
     
     // Location and equipment from workout_preferences JSONB
     workoutLocation: (profile?.workout_preferences?.workout_location || "home") as "home" | "gym" | "outdoors" | "anywhere",
     availableEquipment: Array.isArray(profile?.workout_preferences?.equipment_available) ? 
       profile?.workout_preferences?.equipment_available : 
       ['bodyweight'],
       
     // Fitness goals or focus areas
     focusAreas: Array.isArray(profile?.workout_preferences?.focus_areas) ? 
       profile?.workout_preferences?.focus_areas : 
       Array.isArray(profile?.fitness_goals) ? 
         profile?.fitness_goals : 
         ['full-body'],
         
     // Add additional fields required by the generator
     exercisesToAvoid: profile?.workout_preferences?.exercises_to_avoid?.join(', ') || '',
     country_region: profile?.country_region || '',
     gender: profile?.gender || "neutral",
     age: profile?.age || undefined,
     weight: profile?.weight_kg || undefined,
     height: profile?.height_cm || undefined
   };
   ```

3. **Navigation Protection with Fallbacks**:
   - Enhanced navigation guards to handle both authenticated and non-authenticated states:
   
   ```typescript
   // NavigationGuard in _layout.tsx
   export function NavigationGuard() {
     const { user } = useAuth();
     const { profile } = useProfile();
     const segments = useSegments();
     const router = useRouter();
     
     React.useEffect(() => {
       const inAuthGroup = segments[0] === '(auth)';
       const inOnboardingGroup = segments[0] === '(onboarding)';
       
       // Check if there's a local profile (non-authenticated mode)
       const hasLocalProfile = !user && profile && profile.id && profile.id.startsWith('local_');
       const localOnboardingComplete = hasLocalProfile && profile.has_completed_local_onboarding;
       
       // If user is not authenticated and no local profile, go to login
       if (!user && !hasLocalProfile && !inAuthGroup) {
         router.replace('/(auth)/login');
         return;
       }
       
       // Local profile exists but onboarding not complete
       if (hasLocalProfile && !localOnboardingComplete && !inOnboardingGroup) {
         const currentStep = profile.current_step || 'user-details';
         router.replace(`/(onboarding)/${currentStep}`);
         return;
       }
       
       // Authenticated user with onboarding not complete
       if (user && profile && !profile.has_completed_onboarding && !inOnboardingGroup) {
         const currentStep = profile.current_onboarding_step || 'user-details';
         router.replace(`/(onboarding)/${currentStep}`);
         return;
       }
       
       // Onboarding or auth screens when they should be in main app
       if ((user || localOnboardingComplete) && (inAuthGroup || inOnboardingGroup)) {
         router.replace('/(tabs)');
         return;
       }
     }, [user, profile, segments]);
     
     return null;
   }
   ```

These enhancements ensure the application works seamlessly for both authenticated and non-authenticated users, with robust data handling and repair mechanisms to maintain a high-quality user experience in all scenarios.

## July 2025: Latest Stability and Fixes

### Data Synchronization Overhaul (Consolidation)
- **Centralized Sync Logic**: All primary local-to-cloud data synchronization (including profile, completions, plans, and detailed nutrition tracking) is now handled by `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`. This is invoked by `AuthContext` upon successful sign-in or sign-up.
- **Deprecation of `utils/dataSynchronizer.ts`**: The previous `dataSynchronizer.ts` has had its main migration functionalities removed/commented out, with its core purpose being superseded by `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`.
- **Nutrition Data Sync**: Nutrition tracking data (previously in `local_nutrition_tracking` and legacy `nutrition_tracking` AsyncStorage keys) is now merged into the `profiles.meal_tracking` JSONB field, rather than a separate `nutrition_logs` table. Water tracking remains part of `profile.workout_tracking` and body measurements in `profile.body_analysis`, synced as part of the overall profile object.
- **AsyncStorage Cleanup**: `syncLocalDataToServer.ts` is responsible for clearing out old/legacy AsyncStorage keys (like `completed_workouts`, `meals`, `nutrition_tracking`) after they have been successfully migrated to Supabase.
- **AuthContext Responsibility**: `AuthContext` triggers the new sync flow and its `signOut` method clears a comprehensive list of AsyncStorage keys for a clean user session termination.

### Progress Tab Chart System Overhaul (June 2025)
- **Skia Paint Error Resolution**: Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Paint')" errors that were causing Progress tab crashes
- **Fallback Chart System**: Implemented `FallbackChart.tsx` component using React Native Views for when Skia is unavailable
- **Enhanced Skia Context**: Added auto-detection of Skia availability with comprehensive error handling
- **Real Data Integration**: Fixed meal completion charts to use actual database data instead of mock data
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Charts now work consistently on web, iOS, and Android platforms
- **Performance Optimizations**: Added proper dependency arrays to prevent React Native Reanimated warnings

### Progress Analytics Service (NEW)
- **Centralized Analytics**: Created `services/progressService.ts` for comprehensive progress data management
- **Real-time Data**: Progress charts now display actual user completion data
- **Streak Calculations**: Proper workout and meal completion streak tracking
- **Goal Tracking**: Water intake goal completion and daily averages
- **Data Aggregation**: Weekly, monthly, and custom time range analytics only by profile changes), and another for updating analytics (triggered only by streak value changes). This prevents mutual triggering and infinite loops.
- A `contextReady` state ensures that effects only run when both Auth and Profile contexts are fully loaded.
- All effect dependencies are robust and context-aware, preventing unnecessary re-renders or data fetches.

### Nutrition Tab Meal Completion Persistence Fix
- Removed problematic refs and duplicate/debounced `useEffect` / `useFocusEffect` hooks in `app/(tabs)/nutrition/index.tsx` that caused unreliable meal completion status display.
- Implemented a corrected pattern: a single `useFocusEffect` (using `useCallback` with an empty dependency array) and a primary `useEffect` (with correct dependencies like `mealPlan`, `selectedDay`, `user?.id`) to reliably call `loadCompletedMeals`.
- `loadCompletedMeals` now correctly fetches data via `trackingService` (which interfaces with Supabase/AsyncStorage) and updates the UI state. Internal concurrency guards within `loadCompletedMeals` (using `isLoadingRef`) prevent redundant or concurrent execution, ensuring data is loaded efficiently when the tab is focused or relevant data dependencies change.
- **UI Note**: As part of the AI meal generation simplification (where the LLM now only provides meal names and nutritional information), the "Ingredients" and "Instructions" sections within the meal detail modal in `app/(tabs)/nutrition/index.tsx` are now conditionally rendered. They will only appear if `selectedMeal.recipe.ingredients` or `selectedMeal.recipe.instructions` arrays exist and are not empty. Given the current AI output, these sections will typically be hidden.

### General App Health
- All major flows (onboarding, home, workout, nutrition, progress, profile) are stable and reliable, as confirmed by recent logs and user testing.
- No infinite loops, redundant state updates, or unhandled errors in any tab.
- Data synchronization and persistence are robust across local and server storage.

### Notification System (Web Handling)
- Notification permissions are gracefully handled on web: if denied, the app logs the status and continues without crashing or blocking other features.
- All notification-related errors are caught and do not affect core app functionality.

### Local Mode and Offline Support
- The app now fully supports local/offline mode: users can complete onboarding, generate AI-powered plans, and track progress without authentication.
- All AI features (workout, meal, body analysis) work seamlessly in local mode.
- Data is reliably persisted in AsyncStorage and synchronized with the UI.

### Debug/Developer Tools
- Hidden debug panels and test buttons are available in development mode (`__DEV__` flag) or when `enableDebugMode` is set in the profile.
- Debug panel is accessible at `app/(dev)/debug-panel.tsx` and provides raw profile inspection, data repair, and validation tools.
- Test buttons for AI generation and data repair are present in Nutrition and Workout tabs, hidden from end users in production.

### TypeScript Issues and Workarounds
- Some runtime-only properties are not present in TypeScript definitions; `@ts-ignore` is used as a temporary workaround.
- Plan in place to improve type definitions and remove `@ts-ignore` as soon as possible.

### Known Issues
- Rare React Native text rendering error during profile loading, before UI is fully rendered. Extensive type checking and string conversions have not fully resolved it; ongoing investigation continues.
- All other known issues have been addressed or have robust workarounds in place.

## July 2025: Data Sync Utility and Type Safety Fixes

### Enhanced Data Synchronization Utility

- Introduced `utils/syncLocalDataToSupabase.ts` (which evolved into the current `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`) as the robust utility for syncing local (offline) and Supabase (online) data on login.
- The utility merges workout and meal completions by id and recency, and synchronizes `workout_plan` and `meal_plans` using `updated_at` timestamps or if the server data is null.
- **Nutrition data from `local_nutrition_tracking` (and its legacy counterpart) is merged into the `profiles.meal_tracking` JSONB field.**
- Uses a type guard (`isUserProfile`) to ensure `remoteProfile` is always typed as `UserProfile`, preventing 'never' linter errors.
- All property accesses on remoteProfile are now type-safe and guarded by null checks.
- Linter errors regarding 'never' type for remoteProfile property access have been resolved.
- Both offline (local) and online (Supabase) user flows are now robustly supported, with reliable data migration and sync on login.
- The sync utility is now the single source of truth for merging and updating completions and plans on login.
- Codebase now uses explicit type guards and null checks to prevent TypeScript 'never' errors in all sync and profile logic.
