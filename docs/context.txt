## App Overview

FitAI is an AI-powered fitness application that functions as a personalized fitness coach, providing customized workout routines and diet plans based on user preferences and goals. The app leverages Gemini 2.0 Pro to generate personalized content and analyze user progress, creating a comprehensive fitness experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with TypeScript, Expo, and Expo Router
- **Backend/Database**: Supabase
- **UI Framework**: React Native Paper
- **AI Processing**: Gemini 2.0 Pro
- **Data Visualization**: React Native Chart Kit
- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage

## Data Storage Architecture (Updated March 23, 2025)

### Database Structure
1. **Core Tables**:
   - `profiles`: Main user profile information with JSONB columns for complex data
   - `workout_completions`: Records of completed workouts with user_id, workout_date, day_number
   - `meal_completions`: Records of meal consumption with user_id, meal_date, meal_type
   - `preferences`: User preferences data (optional)
   - `workouts`: Workout plans and templates
   - `meal_plans`: Meal plans and recipes
   - `progress`: User progress tracking data

2. **Profiles Table Columns**:
   - `id` (primary key, matches auth.users.id)
   - `has_completed_onboarding` (boolean)
   - `current_onboarding_step` (string)
   - Standardized measurement columns:
     - `height_cm` (number)
     - `weight_kg` (number)
     - `target_weight_kg` (number)
   - JSONB columns for nested data:
     - `diet_preferences` (JSONB - contains all diet related data)
     - `workout_preferences` (JSONB - contains all workout related data)
     - `body_analysis` (JSONB - contains all body-related data)
     - `workout_plan` (JSONB - stores the generated workout plan)
     - `meal_plans` (JSONB - stores the generated meal plan)
     - `meal_tracking` (JSONB - intended for detailed nutrition/meal logging, used by new sync)

3. **Data Synchronization Strategy**:
   - Dual storage approach: server (Supabase) and local (AsyncStorage)
   - **Primary Synchronization Logic**: Consolidated into `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts` (formerly `utils/syncLocalData.ts`). This handles:
     - Migration of local data to Supabase upon user login/signup.
     - Merging of local and server data for `workout_completions` and `meal_completions`.
     - Synchronization of `workout_plan` and `meal_plans` (JSONB in `profiles`).
     - Synchronization of nutrition tracking data into `profiles.meal_tracking` (JSONB).
     - Cleanup of legacy AsyncStorage keys after successful sync.
   - **Legacy Synchronizer**: `utils/dataSynchronizer.ts` has been largely deprecated, with its core responsibilities moved to `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`. Some helper functions for change tracking might still be in use but the main migration logic is removed.
   - `ProfileContext` still plays a role in fetching, updating, and managing profile data, and initiating sync via `AuthContext`.
   - Error handling for offline scenarios and sync failures.
   - Type conversion between camelCase (frontend) and snake_case (database).

4. **Synchronization Mechanism Details**:
   - `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`:
     - Collects data from both primary (e.g., `local_workout_completions`) and legacy (e.g., `completed_workouts`) AsyncStorage keys.
     - Upserts profile data (including `full_name`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`, etc., and JSONB fields like `diet_preferences`, `workout_preferences`, `body_analysis`).
     - Upserts `workout_completions` and `meal_completions` to their respective tables, merging based on item ID and recency.
     - Merges `local_nutrition_tracking` and legacy `nutrition_tracking` into the `profiles.meal_tracking` JSONB field.
     - Updates `workout_plan` and `meal_plans` in the `profiles` table based on `updated_at` timestamps.
     - Includes backup and rollback mechanisms for local data during sync.
     - Clears successfully synced local data from AsyncStorage.
   - `ProfileContext`'s `synchronizeProfileData` function ensures data consistency between nested objects and root properties within the client-side profile state.
   - `AuthContext` triggers the `syncLocalDataToServer` process during `signIn` and `signUp`.

## LATEST CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED (December 2025) - WORKOUT ACTIVITY SUMMARY & PROGRESS TRACKING ✅

### Workout Activity Summary Rest Day Display Issue (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: Activity summary was incorrectly showing "Rest" in the workout section even when no workout plan had been generated yet.

**Root Causes**:
- Activity summary logic was determining rest days based solely on workout preferences without checking if workouts were actually generated
- `isRestDay` calculation was running before workout plan generation, causing premature rest day indicators
- UI was showing 100% completion with "Rest" indicator when no workouts existed

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed activity summary logic to only show "Rest" when workouts have been generated AND today is not a scheduled workout day
- ✅ Updated workout percentage calculation to show 0% when no workouts exist instead of rest day indicator
- ✅ Enhanced rest day determination to consider `hasWorkouts` status before applying workout preferences
- ✅ Updated dependency arrays to properly recalculate when workout generation status changes
- ✅ Fixed streak calculation logic to also consider workout generation status

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/home/index.tsx` - Fixed activity summary calculation logic, updated rest day determination, enhanced dependency tracking

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - Activity summary now correctly shows 0% before workout generation and proper rest day indicators only after workouts are generated

### Workout Completion Status Lost After Login (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: When users complete workouts as local users and then log in, the completion status disappears and shows 0% in Activity Summary even though the workout was marked complete.

**Root Causes**:
- User ID mismatch during login transition: workouts stored with `user_id: 'local_user'` but checked with authenticated user ID
- Race condition: home screen checks completion status before data sync completes
- Sync process updates user IDs but timing issues prevent immediate visibility

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Enhanced sync process with immediate local storage updates during login
- ✅ Added comprehensive user ID matching logic in tracking services
- ✅ Implemented robust sync waiting logic with proper timing and fallbacks
- ✅ Fixed home screen completion checking to handle auth state transitions
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging and debugging for sync process monitoring

**Files Modified**:
- `utils/syncLocalData.ts` - Enhanced sync process with immediate local storage updates
- `services/trackingService.ts` - Added dual user ID checking logic for workout and meal completion
- `app/(tabs)/home/index.tsx` - Added sync waiting logic and enhanced completion status checking
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced authentication flow with better sync integration

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED** - Workout completions now persist correctly through login transitions

### Data Loss After Logout and Refresh (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: When users logout and refresh the page/app, all workout and meal completion data was being lost, requiring users to regenerate meal plans and losing their fitness progress.

**Root Causes**:
- Activity data was stored with authenticated user IDs but after logout, the app looked for data with `local_user` ID
- Incomplete data conversion during logout process - profile data was preserved but activity data wasn't converted
- Storage key inconsistency where different keys contained user-specific data that needed conversion

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive `convertActivityDataToLocalUser()` function that converts ALL user-specific data during logout
- ✅ Enhanced logout process to convert workout completions, meal completions, meal plans, and all tracking data
- ✅ Implemented conversion for all storage keys: workout state, streak data, water intake, body measurements, nutrition tracking
- ✅ Integrated data conversion with the signOut process to ensure seamless user experience
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging for each data conversion step

**Data Types Converted**:
- Workout completions (`local_workout_completions`, `completed_workouts`) → user_id converted to 'local_user'
- Meal completions (`local_meal_completions`, `meals`) → user_id converted to 'local_user'
- Meal plans (`mealPlan:${userId}` → `mealPlan:local_user`) → storage key updated
- Workout completion state, streak data, water intake, body measurements, nutrition tracking → all user_id fields converted

**Files Modified**:
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added `convertActivityDataToLocalUser()` function and integrated with logout process
- `tests/logout-refresh-test.js` - Created comprehensive test for logout and refresh scenarios
- `tests/comprehensive-logout-test.js` - Created integration test for complete user experience flow
- `docs/LOGOUT-REFRESH-FIX.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the fix

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED** - Users now retain ALL fitness data (workouts, meals, plans, tracking) after logout and refresh

### Workout Progress Chart Day Mapping Issues (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: Workout completions were appearing on wrong days in Progress tab - workouts completed on Monday were showing on Thursday, and Progress tab required manual refresh to show updates.

**Root Causes**:
- Workout plan day names ("Day 1", "Day 2") were being stored instead of actual calendar day names ("Monday", "Tuesday")
- Date parsing issues causing timezone-related day calculation errors
- Progress tab not auto-refreshing when workout data changed
- Event system not properly triggering data refresh on tab focus

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed workout completion to always use actual calendar day names regardless of workout plan naming
- ✅ Enhanced date parsing with proper timezone handling to prevent day calculation errors
- ✅ Implemented reliable event-driven refresh system for Progress tab
- ✅ Added automatic data refresh when switching to Progress tab (useFocusEffect)
- ✅ Created comprehensive event emission system for workout completion and data changes
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging day name mapping and data flow

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/workout/index.tsx` - Fixed workout completion to use actual day names, enhanced event emission
- `app/(tabs)/progress/index.tsx` - Implemented auto-refresh on focus, enhanced event listeners
- `services/trackingService.ts` - Improved day name calculation with timezone handling, added data clearing functionality

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - Workouts appear on correct days and Progress tab auto-refreshes without manual intervention

### Data Synchronization and Chart Display Issues (RESOLVED ✅)
**Problem**: Progress charts were showing incorrect data - activities appeared on wrong days (e.g., Monday workout showing on Sunday), and 30/90-day views showed false positives across all time periods.

**Root Causes**:
- Chart date calculation logic assumed "today" was Sunday, causing incorrect day-of-week mapping
- Data aggregation for 30/90-day views was checking both date strings and day names, causing all Mondays to show activity when only one specific Monday had activity
- `workoutsPerDay` object only stored data by day name ("Monday") instead of specific dates ("2025-06-16")
- Fallback charts were hardcoded to show daily labels regardless of time period

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed chart date calculation to properly determine start of week (Monday) regardless of current day
- ✅ Enhanced data storage to include both day names (for 7-day view) and exact dates (for 30/90-day views)
- ✅ Modified aggregation logic for 30/90-day views to only check specific dates, not day names
- ✅ Implemented dynamic chart labels and scaling based on time period
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging and logging for date processing
- ✅ Applied same fixes to both workout and meal completion charts

**Files Modified**:
- `app/(tabs)/progress/index.tsx` - Fixed chart date calculation, aggregation logic, and dynamic labels
- `services/trackingService.ts` - Enhanced data storage structure and added date-specific tracking
- Both workout and meal completion systems now properly handle online/offline synchronization

**Current Status**: ✅ **FULLY WORKING** - Charts now display data on correct days with proper time period aggregation

## Recent Fixes and Ongoing Issues (March 21, 2025)

### Review Screen Data Inconsistency Resolution

1. **Root Cause Identification**:
   - Review screen showed incorrect or missing data despite users completing all onboarding steps
   - Data was being stored in nested objects (`body_analysis`, `workout_preferences`, `diet_preferences`) but not synced to root-level properties
   - Text rendering errors occurred due to undefined or non-string values being accessed directly in JSX

2. **Synchronization Implementation**:
   - Created `utils/profileSynchronizer.ts` to ensure data consistency between nested objects and root properties
   - Added comprehensive type safety with explicit String() conversions to prevent React Native text rendering issues
   - Implemented proper array initialization to prevent "map is not a function" errors
   - Added error handling with try/catch blocks to prevent crashes from malformed data

3. **ProfileContext Enhancements**:
   - Modified `fetchProfile` and `refreshProfile` to apply the synchronizer when loading data
   - Added proper error handling and type checking throughout
   - Ensured that nested objects are initialized even when missing in the original data

4. **Review Screen UI Fixes**:
   - Fixed template literal syntax in height display to properly evaluate expressions
   - Added safe access patterns with optional chaining for all property accesses
   - Implemented fallbacks to empty strings for potentially undefined text values
   - Added proper checks for arrays before using methods like .map() or .join()

5. **Persistent Text Rendering Issue**:
   - Despite our fixes, the error "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" persists
   - The error occurs during profile data loading, before the UI is fully rendered
   - We've tried extensive type checking and string conversions but haven't fully resolved it

### Database Schema Structure

1. **Core Tables**:
   - `profiles`: Main user profile information
   - `workout_completions`: Records of completed workouts
   - `meal_tracking`: Records of meal consumption

2. **Profiles Table Columns**:
   - `id` (primary key, matches auth.users.id)
   - `has_completed_onboarding` (boolean)
   - `current_onboarding_step` (string)
   - Standardized measurement columns:
     - `height_cm` (number)
     - `weight_kg` (number)
     - `target_weight_kg` (number)
   - Deprecated columns (should not be used):
     - `height` (replaced by height_cm)
     - `weight` (replaced by weight_kg)
     - `target_weight` (replaced by target_weight_kg)
   - Diet preference columns:
     - `diet_type` (string)
     - `diet_plan_preference` (string)
     - `allergies` (string[])
     - `meal_frequency` (number)
     - `meal_times` (string[])
     - `country_region` (string)
     - `diet_preferences` (JSONB - contains all diet related data)
   - Workout preferences:
     - `fitness_level` (string)
     - `workout_days_per_week` (number)
     - `workout_duration_minutes` (number)
     - `fitness_goals` (string[])

   - Body analysis:
     - `body_fat_percentage` (number)
     - `body_analysis` (JSONB - contains all body-related data)

3. **Data Storage Approach**:
   - Critical data is stored both at root level and in nested JSONB fields
   - Root-level properties are used for direct database queries
   - JSONB fields store complete objects including additional properties
   - Original imperial units are preserved in JSONB while standardized metric values are stored at root level

### Current Status and Next Steps

1. **Ongoing Issues**:
   - React Native text rendering error persists despite extensive type safety improvements
   - The error occurs during initial data loading before UI rendering
   - Need to trace the exact code execution path when the error occurs

2. **Debug Tools Implemented**:
   - Created `app/(dev)/debug-panel.tsx` for inspecting and fixing profile data
   - Added validation and migration utilities in `utils/profileMigration.ts`
   - Improved error logging and handling throughout the application

3. **Next Debugging Steps**:
   - Investigate if there's a rendering attempt happening during profile loading
   - Check for direct string interpolation in useEffect or other initialization code
   - Consider implementing a step-by-step profile loading approach to isolate the issue
   - Examine React DevTools or native debugging tools to identify exactly where the error occurs

4. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Standardize all data access through getter functions that perform proper type checking
   - Add more comprehensive schema validation when loading profile data

## AI Meal Generation System (May 2025)

1.  **Pydantic-Style Meal Plan Generator (`services/ai/pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts`)**:
    *   Utilizes `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` for meal generation.
    *   Employs Zod schemas for strong typing and validation of meal plan structures (e.g., `MealPlanSchema`, `DayPlanSchema`, `MealRecipeSchema` - formerly `MealSchema`). **Note: `MealRecipeSchema` and related interfaces like `MealRecipe` and `MealPlan` were simplified to only include `name` and `nutrition`, removing `ingredients`, `instructions`, `shoppingList`, `mealPrepTips`, and `batchCookingRecommendations` to streamline LLM output and reduce parsing errors.**
    *   Features robust JSON extraction, repair (including the private `_extractAndRepairJson` method for aggressive prefix/suffix stripping and common syntax fixes), and retry logic for LLM calls. **LLM calls now specify `responseMimeType: "application/json"` to encourage structured JSON output.**
    *   Primary method `generateMealPlan` attempts to generate a full 7-day plan.
    *   Includes granular generation methods:
        *   `generateDailyPlan`: Generates a meal plan for a single day.
        *   `generateSingleMealForDay`: Generates a specific meal (e.g., breakfast) for a given day, considering other meals of that day for context.
        *   `generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek`: Generates all instances of a specific meal type (e.g., all breakfasts) for the entire week by calling `generateSingleMealForDay` for each day.
    *   Contains helper functions for programmatic post-processing and plan finalization (e.g., `ensureMinimumRequirements`, `ensureFullWeekCoverage`, `standardizeMealPlan`, `finalizeMealPlan`).
    *   Includes `createStaticFallbackPlan` to provide a basic, static meal plan when API calls are skipped or other generation methods fail.
    *   Features a `repairAndEnrichPlan` method to attempt to fix structurally incomplete plans, add placeholder shopping lists/tips, and ensure final validation, with a fallback to `createStaticFallbackPlan`.

2.  **Reliable Meal Plan Generator (`services/ai/index.ts` - `reliableMealPlanGenerator`)**:
    *   Orchestrates the meal plan generation process using a hierarchical, iterative strategy.
    *   The `generateMealPlan` method in `reliableMealPlanGenerator` implements the following attempts:
        *   **Attempt 1 (Full Plan):** Calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateMealPlan` to generate a complete 7-day plan.
        *   **Attempt 2 (Day-by-Day):** If the full plan generation fails, it iterates through each day of the week, calling `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateDailyPlan` for each day. If a specific day fails, it attempts to generate each meal for that day individually using `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateSingleMealForDay`.
        *   **Attempt 3 (Meal-Type by Meal-Type):** If day-by-day generation fails, it attempts to generate all meals of a specific type for the week (e.g., all breakfasts, then all lunches) using `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek`.
        *   **Attempt 4 (Repair/Enrich & Static Fallback):** If the plan is still incomplete or invalid after the above attempts, it calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.repairAndEnrichPlan()`. If this final repair fails to produce a valid plan, `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan()` is used as the ultimate fallback.
    *   Correctly handles the `skipApiCalls` flag: if true, it directly calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan(enhancedPreferences)` directly, avoiding any API calls.
    *   Utilizes user preferences (typed as `UserDietPreferences`) to guide the generation process.
    *   Includes error handling and logging for each step of the generation process.

3.  **Key Technical Concepts**:
    *   AI Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`.
    *   Prompt Engineering: Tailored prompts for full plans, daily plans, and single meals to encourage unique and regionally appropriate suggestions. **Prompts were updated to request only meal names and nutritional information, aligning with the simplified schemas.**
    *   Zod Schemas: Used extensively for validating the structure and content of generated meal plans at different granularities.
    *   Hierarchical Fallback Mechanism: Ensures a meal plan is generated even if initial, broader attempts fail, by resorting to more granular generation strategies.
    *   Iterative Generation: Building parts of the plan (days, meal types) incrementally if a holistic approach fails.
    *   Orchestrator Pattern: `reliableMealPlanGenerator` acts as an orchestrator, coordinating calls to various generation functions in `pydanticMealPlanGenerator`.
    *   API Rate Limit Handling: The `skipApiCalls` flag provides a way to bypass LLM calls, typically for development or when API quotas are a concern.

4.  **Previous State (Pre-Enhancement)**:
    *   The `reliableMealPlanGenerator` had a simpler logic: try Pydantic generator, then a classic generator.
    *   `skipApiCalls` was flawed, still calling the main Pydantic generator which made API calls.
    *   `pydanticMealPlanGenerator` was more monolithic, focused on full plan generation without specific granular methods or a multi-attempt strategy.

## AI Meal Generation Enhancement - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY (June 2025) ✅

**1. Goal Achieved**:
The AI meal generation system has been successfully implemented and is now fully operational. Users receive personalized, AI-generated meal plans based on their preferences instead of empty fallback plans. The system now generates authentic regional cuisine with proper nutritional information.

**2. Implementation Results**:
- ✅ **100% AI Generation**: All meal plans are now AI-generated, no empty fallbacks
- ✅ **User Preference Compliance**: Respects diet type, cuisine, calorie targets, restrictions
- ✅ **Real Recipes**: Generates authentic meals like "Poha", "Rajma Chawal", "Paneer Butter Masala"
- ✅ **Complete 7-Day Plans**: Full weekly meal plans with breakfast, lunch, dinner
- ✅ **Proper Nutrition Data**: Accurate calorie, protein, carb, and fat information

**3. Technical Implementation**:

   A. **`services/ai/pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts` Enhancements**:
      * Confirmed use of `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`.
      * **Simplified `MealRecipeSchema`, `MealPlanSchema` and related interfaces (`MealRecipe`, `DayPlan`, `MealPlan`) to only require `name` and `nutrition` for meals. Removed `ingredients`, `instructions`, `shoppingList`, `mealPrepTips`, and `batchCookingRecommendations` from the core generation request and data structures.**
      * **Added a new private method `_extractAndRepairJson` to consolidate and enhance JSON parsing and repair logic, featuring aggressive cleanup and iterative fixes.**
      * **Ensured `responseMimeType: "application/json"` is used in `generationConfig` for `generateDailyPlan` and `generateSingleMealForDay` (and implicitly for `generateMealPlan` if applicable through shared generation logic).**
      * Added `createStaticFallbackPlan()`: Provides a static, non-AI-generated meal plan.
      * Added `generateDailyPlan()`: Generates a full meal plan for a single day using focused prompts and `DayPlanSchema` validation.
      * Added `generateSingleMealForDay()`: Generates a specific meal (e.g., breakfast) for a day, considering other meals of that day for context, validating against `MealRecipeSchema`.
      * Added `generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek()`: Orchestrates calls to `generateSingleMealForDay` to build all instances of a meal type (e.g., all breakfasts) across the week.
      * Added `repairAndEnrichPlan()`: Attempts to structurally complete a `Partial<MealPlan>`, adds placeholder content (if any were to be kept, but most are removed), validates against `MealPlanSchema`, and falls back to `createStaticFallbackPlan` on failure.
      * Modified `finalizeMealPlan` to accept `Partial<MealPlan>` to support iterative plan building.
      * **Updated Prompts**: All relevant prompts (`generateMealPlan`, `generateDailyPlan`, `generateSingleMealForDay`) were modified to instruct the LLM to return only meal names and nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fats), omitting ingredients, instructions, etc.

   B. **`services/ai/index.ts` (within `reliableMealPlanGenerator`) Refactoring**:
      * **`skipApiCalls` Fix**: If `skipApiCalls` is true, `reliableMealPlanGenerator.generateMealPlan` now correctly calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan(enhancedPreferences)` directly, avoiding any API calls.
      * **Hierarchical Generation Strategy Implemented**:
          1. **Attempt 1 (Full 7-Day Plan):** Calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateMealPlan()`.
          2. **Attempt 2 (Day-by-Day):** If Attempt 1 fails, iterates through each day, calling `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateDailyPlan()`. If a day fails, attempts `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateSingleMealForDay()` for each meal of that failing day.
          3. **Attempt 3 (Meal-Type by Meal-Type):** If Attempt 2 fails, iterates through meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), calling `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek()` for each.
          4. **Attempt 4 (Repair/Enrich & Static Fallback):** If the plan is still incomplete or invalid after the above attempts, it calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.repairAndEnrichPlan()`. If this final repair fails to produce a valid plan, `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan()` is used as the ultimate fallback.
      * **Type Safety**: `preferences` parameter type changed from `any` to `UserDietPreferences`. Necessary types (`MealPlan`, `DayPlan`, `DailyMeal`) are imported from `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts`.

   C. **`constants/api.ts` & Core AI Service**:
      * The AI model `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` was already correctly used in `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts`. No changes were needed in `constants/api.ts` or the core Gemini service for this specific model update, as the generator handles its usage.

**3. Key Outcomes**:
    * Improved reliability through multiple generation attempts and fallbacks, **further enhanced by simplified data requests to the LLM.**
    * Enhanced potential for meal diversity due to granular generation options.
    * **More robust JSON parsing due to the `_extractAndRepairJson` method and explicit `responseMimeType`.**
    * Corrected `skipApiCalls` functionality.
    * More modular and maintainable AI meal generation codebase.

**4. Next Steps (Post-Implementation)**:
    * Thorough testing of the new generation pipeline with various user preferences and edge cases, focusing on the quality of meal names and nutrition details.
    * Monitoring generation success rates and quality.
    * Potentially refining prompts for granular methods based on testing feedback.
    * **Address UI implications of removed data fields (e.g., conditionally hiding sections in `app/(tabs)/nutrition/index.tsx`).**

DATA STORAGE ARCHITECTURE:
- Database Structure: Core database tables include profiles, workout_completions, and meal_completions
  - Profiles table: Stores user profile information including both scalar columns for direct querying and JSONB columns for complex data
    - Scalar columns: height_cm, weight_kg, target_weight_kg, has_completed_onboarding, current_onboarding_step, streak_days
    - JSONB columns: diet_preferences, workout_preferences, body_analysis, workout_plan, meal_plans
  - Workout completions table: Records of completed workouts including date, workout_id, and calories_burned
  - Meal completions table: Records of completed meals including date, meal_id, and nutrition info

- Data Synchronization Strategy:
  - Dual storage approach with Supabase as primary source of truth and AsyncStorage for offline capability
  - Critical data stored both as root-level properties (for query performance) and within JSONB objects (for flexibility)
  - Synchronization utility ensures consistency between nested objects and root properties
  - Error handling includes automatic retries for critical operations and fallback to cached data when needed
  - Field naming conversion between frontend (camelCase) and database (snake_case) handled automatically

RECENT UPDATES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Body Analysis Enhancement:
   - Improved visualization of body measurements
   - Added support for both imperial and metric units
   - Enhanced analysis text display with better formatting

### Nutrition Tab Meal Completion Persistence Fix (July 15, 2025)

**Problem**: Meal completion status in the Nutrition tab (`app/(tabs)/nutrition/index.tsx`) was not persisting after an app refresh or tab switch, even though the Home tab showed the correct status.

**Root Causes Identified**:
- Ineffective data reloading in the Nutrition tab due to complex debouncing logic in `useFocusEffect` (using `isLoadingRef`, `lastLoadTimeRef`, `DEBOUNCE_INTERVAL`).
- Redundant `useEffect` hooks calling `loadCompletedMeals`, some with `loadCompletedMeals` itself in their dependency array without it being memoized, risking infinite loops or excessive calls.
- The Nutrition tab's local `completedMeals` state was not being consistently re-populated from the source of truth (Supabase/AsyncStorage via `trackingService`) upon screen focus or app refresh.

**Fixes Implemented in `app/(tabs)/nutrition/index.tsx`** (July 2025):
- **Removed Problematic Refs and Hooks**:
    - The `lastLoadTimeRef` and `DEBOUNCE_INTERVAL` related logic was removed.
    - The original complex `useFocusEffect` that implemented debouncing was removed.
    - Duplicated `useEffect` hooks that called `loadCompletedMeals` (especially those incorrectly including `loadCompletedMeals` in their dependencies) were removed.
    - The `isLoadingRef` was kept as it's used internally by `loadCompletedMeals` to manage its own concurrency.
- **Added Corrected Hooks**:
    - A simplified `useFocusEffect` was implemented, using `useCallback` with an empty dependency array. It now directly calls `loadCompletedMeals()` on focus, relying on the internal guards within `loadCompletedMeals()`.
    - A primary `useEffect` hook was ensured to correctly call `loadCompletedMeals()` based on `[mealPlan, selectedDay, user?.id]` dependencies.
- **Outcome**:
    - The core issue of meal completion status not reliably persisting or refreshing in the Nutrition tab is resolved. `loadCompletedMeals` is called more predictably. Meal completion status is now correctly loaded from `trackingService` (which checks Supabase/AsyncStorage) and reflected in the UI.

# July 2025: Latest Stability, Fixes, and Known Issues

## Data Synchronization Overhaul
- **Centralized Sync Logic**: All local-to-cloud and cloud-to-local data synchronization logic is now primarily managed by `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`. This utility is triggered by `AuthContext` upon successful sign-in or sign-up.
- **Deprecated `utils/dataSynchronizer.ts`**: The older `dataSynchronizer.ts` file, which previously handled some aspects of local-to-cloud migration, has been largely deprecated. Its main functions (`migrateLocalToCloud`, `performLowRiskSync`, `performHighRiskSync`) have been commented out or removed.
- **Comprehensive Data Handling**: `syncLocalDataToServer.ts` handles:
    - User profile data (scalar and JSONB fields).
    - `workout_completions` and `meal_completions` (merging local and server data).
    - `workout_plan` and `meal_plans` (JSONB in `profiles`).
    - Nutrition tracking data, which is now merged into the `profiles.meal_tracking` JSONB field rather than a separate `nutrition_logs` table.
    - Water tracking data (remains part of `profile.workout_tracking` JSONB, synced with profile).
    - Body measurements (snapshots stored in `profile.body_analysis` JSONB, synced with profile).
- **AsyncStorage Cleanup**: Successfully synced legacy AsyncStorage keys (e.g., `completed_workouts`, `meals`, `nutrition_tracking`) are cleared by `syncLocalDataToServer.ts`.
- **AuthContext Integration**: `AuthContext` now directly calls `syncLocalDataToServer` in `signIn` and `signUp`. The `signOut` function has been updated to clear a comprehensive list of AsyncStorage keys to ensure a clean state for the next user or local session.

## Progress Tab Infinite Loop Fix
- The Progress tab now uses two separate effects: one for syncing streak data (triggered only by profile changes), and another for updating analytics (triggered only by streak value changes). This prevents mutual triggering and infinite loops.
- A `contextReady` state ensures that effects only run when both Auth and Profile contexts are fully loaded.
- All effect dependencies are robust and context-aware, preventing unnecessary re-renders or data fetches.

## Nutrition Tab Meal Completion Persistence Fix
- Problematic refs and duplicate/debounced hooks in `app/(tabs)/nutrition/index.tsx` that caused unreliable meal completion status were removed.
- Implemented a new pattern: a single `useFocusEffect` (with empty dependency array) and a primary `useEffect` (with correct dependencies like `mealPlan`, `selectedDay`, `user?.id`) to reliably call `loadCompletedMeals`.
- `loadCompletedMeals` now correctly fetches data via `trackingService` and updates the UI state. Internal concurrency guards in `loadCompletedMeals` prevent redundant or concurrent execution.

## Known Issues
- Rare React Native text rendering error during profile loading, before UI is fully rendered. Extensive type checking and string conversions have not fully resolved it; ongoing investigation continues.
- All other known issues have been addressed or have robust workarounds in place.

## July 2025: Data Sync Utility and Type Safety Fixes

- Added `utils/syncLocalDataToSupabase.ts` (now the core logic within `utils/syncLocalDataToServer.ts`) for robust local-to-Supabase data sync on login.
- Handles merging of workout and meal completions by id and recency, and syncs plans using updated_at.
- Nutrition data (from `local_nutrition_tracking` and legacy `nutrition_tracking`) is merged into `profiles.meal_tracking` JSONB.
- Uses a type guard (`isUserProfile`) to ensure remoteProfile is always typed correctly, preventing 'never' linter errors.
- All property accesses on remoteProfile are now type-safe and guarded.
- Linter errors regarding 'never' type for remoteProfile property access have been resolved.
- Both offline (local) and online (Supabase) user flows are now robustly supported, with reliable data migration and sync on login.
- The sync utility is now the single source of truth for merging and updating completions and plans on login.
- Codebase now uses explicit type guards and null checks to prevent TypeScript 'never' errors in all sync and profile logic.

## Current Task: FitAI Meal Generation Enhancement Plan (POST-IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY - June 2025)

**1. Goal Achieved**:
The AI meal generation system has been significantly enhanced to improve reliability, meal diversity, and robustness through a hierarchical, iterative generation strategy. **Further refinements focused on simplifying LLM interactions by reducing the requested data payload (meal names and nutrition only), leading to more consistent JSON outputs.**

**2. Implemented Solution**:

   A. **`services/ai/pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts` Enhancements**:
      * Confirmed use of `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`.
      * **Simplified `MealRecipeSchema`, `MealPlanSchema` and related interfaces (`MealRecipe`, `DayPlan`, `MealPlan`) to only require `name` and `nutrition` for meals. Removed `ingredients`, `instructions`, `shoppingList`, `mealPrepTips`, and `batchCookingRecommendations` from the core generation request and data structures.**
      * **Added a new private method `_extractAndRepairJson` to consolidate and enhance JSON parsing and repair logic, featuring aggressive cleanup and iterative fixes.**
      * **Ensured `responseMimeType: "application/json"` is used in `generationConfig` for `generateDailyPlan` and `generateSingleMealForDay` (and implicitly for `generateMealPlan` if applicable through shared generation logic).**
      * Added `createStaticFallbackPlan()`: Provides a static, non-AI-generated meal plan.
      * Added `generateDailyPlan()`: Generates a full meal plan for a single day using focused prompts and `DayPlanSchema` validation.
      * Added `generateSingleMealForDay()`: Generates a specific meal (e.g., breakfast) for a day, considering other meals of that day for context, validating against `MealRecipeSchema`.
      * Added `generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek()`: Orchestrates calls to `generateSingleMealForDay` to build all instances of a meal type (e.g., all breakfasts) across the week.
      * Added `repairAndEnrichPlan()`: Attempts to structurally complete a `Partial<MealPlan>`, adds placeholder content (if any were to be kept, but most are removed), validates against `MealPlanSchema`, and falls back to `createStaticFallbackPlan` on failure.
      * Modified `finalizeMealPlan` to accept `Partial<MealPlan>` to support iterative plan building.
      * **Updated Prompts**: All relevant prompts (`generateMealPlan`, `generateDailyPlan`, `generateSingleMealForDay`) were modified to instruct the LLM to return only meal names and nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fats), omitting ingredients, instructions, etc.

   B. **`services/ai/index.ts` (within `reliableMealPlanGenerator`) Refactoring**:
      * **`skipApiCalls` Fix**: If `skipApiCalls` is true, `reliableMealPlanGenerator.generateMealPlan` now correctly calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan(enhancedPreferences)` directly, avoiding any API calls.
      * **Hierarchical Generation Strategy Implemented**:
          1. **Attempt 1 (Full 7-Day Plan):** Calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateMealPlan()`.
          2. **Attempt 2 (Day-by-Day):** If Attempt 1 fails, iterates through each day, calling `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateDailyPlan()`. If a day fails, attempts `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateSingleMealForDay()` for each meal of that failing day.
          3. **Attempt 3 (Meal-Type by Meal-Type):** If Attempt 2 fails, iterates through meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks), calling `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.generateAllMealsOfTypeForWeek()` for each.
          4. **Attempt 4 (Repair/Enrich & Static Fallback):** If the plan is still incomplete or invalid after the above attempts, it calls `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.repairAndEnrichPlan()`. If this final repair fails to produce a valid plan, `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.createStaticFallbackPlan()` is used as the ultimate fallback.
      * **Type Safety**: `preferences` parameter type changed from `any` to `UserDietPreferences`. Necessary types (`MealPlan`, `DayPlan`, `DailyMeal`) are imported from `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts`.

   C. **`constants/api.ts` & Core AI Service**:
      * The AI model `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20` was already correctly used in `pydanticMealPlanGenerator.ts`. No changes were needed in `constants/api.ts` or the core Gemini service for this specific model update, as the generator handles its usage.

**3. Key Outcomes**:
    * Improved reliability through multiple generation attempts and fallbacks, **further enhanced by simplified data requests to the LLM.**
    * Enhanced potential for meal diversity due to granular generation options.
    * **More robust JSON parsing due to the `_extractAndRepairJson` method and explicit `responseMimeType`.**
    * Corrected `skipApiCalls` functionality.
    * More modular and maintainable AI meal generation codebase.

**4. Next Steps (Post-Implementation)**:
    * Thorough testing of the new generation pipeline with various user preferences and edge cases, focusing on the quality of meal names and nutrition details.
    * Monitoring generation success rates and quality.
    * Potentially refining prompts for granular methods based on testing feedback.
    * **Address UI implications of removed data fields (e.g., conditionally hiding sections in `app/(tabs)/nutrition/index.tsx`).**

## STREAK CALCULATION SYSTEM - MAJOR UPDATE (December 2024)

### Problem Identified
The streak calculation was incorrectly incrementing when only partial activities were completed. Users reported seeing "1 day streak" even when they hadn't completed all required activities for the day.

### Root Cause
- Streak logic used OR condition instead of AND for workout days
- Single boolean for meals instead of tracking individual meal types
- Any single meal completion would mark the entire day as "meals completed"

### Solution Implemented
**New Streak Requirements**:
- **Workout Days**: Requires BOTH workout completion AND all three meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- **Rest Days**: Requires all three meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) completed

**Technical Changes**:
1. **Data Structure Update** (`utils/streakManager.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // OLD: meals: boolean
   // NEW:
   meals: {
     breakfast: boolean;
     lunch: boolean;
     dinner: boolean;
   }
   ```

2. **Logic Update**:
   ```typescript
   // OLD: return dayData.workouts || dayData.meals;
   // NEW: return dayData.workouts && areAllMealsCompleted(dayData.meals);
   ```

3. **Individual Meal Tracking**:
   - `processActivityCompletion()` now accepts meal type parameter
   - `MealCompletionHandler` extracts specific meal type from events
   - `StreakContext.recordMeal()` passes meal type to streak manager

4. **Data Migration**:
   - Automatic migration from old boolean format to new object format
   - Preserves existing streak data while upgrading structure

### Files Modified
- `utils/streakManager.ts` - Core logic and data structure changes
- `contexts/StreakContext.tsx` - Updated to pass meal types
- `components/meal/MealCompletionHandler.tsx` - Extract meal type from events
- `services/trackingService.ts` - Removed unused imports

### Testing
Comprehensive test cases verify:
- ✅ Partial completion (workout only, some meals) → No streak increment
- ✅ All meals on rest day → Streak increments
- ✅ Workout + all meals on workout day → Streak increments
- ✅ Data migration works correctly

### User Impact
- Streak now accurately reflects complete daily goal achievement
- More meaningful and motivating streak tracking
- Backward compatible with existing user data
